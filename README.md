Title: Asset Tracker

Description: 

In this project I have created An Asset Tracking Database. Asset Tracking is a way for a company to keep track of the company assets, like Laptops, stationary computers, phones and other products. All assets have an end of life and old products are highlighted with red mark. Products that are six months from being three years old are marked with yellow for the customer to be informed of product age. 

In this Console Database the customer will have displayed the asset database with localprice across different Offices and the local currency is converted to the productprice in EURO and is updated daily through fetched API.
